# Custom Meshachvetz Configuration Example - Updated with Student-First Priorities
# This shows how to create a custom configuration with different weights
# Prioritizes student satisfaction first, then behavior/studentiality distribution

weights:
  # Student Layer: Individual satisfaction metrics
  student_layer:
    friends: 0.8      # Increased focus on friend placement (was 0.7)
    dislikes: 0.2     # Reduced focus on conflict avoidance (was 0.3)
  
  # Class Layer: Intra-class balance metrics
  class_layer:
    gender_balance: 1.0   # Keep gender balance important
  
  # School Layer: Inter-class balance metrics  
  school_layer:
    academic_balance: 0.05        # Reduced academic balance importance (was 0.1)
    behavior_balance: 0.45        # High behavior balance importance (was 0.5)
    studentiality_balance: 0.35   # High studentiality balance importance (new)
    size_balance: 0.05           # Reduced size balance importance (was 0.2)
    assistance_balance: 0.1       # Reduced assistance balance importance (was 0.2)
  
  # Layer Weights: How much each layer contributes to final score
  layers:
    student: 0.8    # Increased student satisfaction weight (was 0.6)
    class: 0.05     # Reduced class balance weight (was 0.1)
    school: 0.15    # Reduced school balance weight (was 0.3)

# Class Configuration: Parameters for class organization
class_config:
  target_classes: 4           # Different target number of classes (was 5)
  min_class_size: 20          # Larger minimum class size (was 15)
  max_class_size: 35          # Larger maximum class size (was 30)
  preferred_class_size: 28    # Larger preferred class size (was 25)
  allow_uneven_classes: false # Require more even classes (was true)

# Normalization Factors: Adjusted for different sensitivity
normalization:
  academic_score_factor: 1.5          # Less sensitive to academic imbalances (was 2.0)
  behavior_rank_factor: 40.0          # More sensitive to behavior imbalances (was 35.0)
  studentiality_rank_factor: 40.0     # More sensitive to studentiality imbalances (new)
  class_size_factor: 8.0              # More sensitive to size imbalances (was 5.0)
  assistance_count_factor: 15.0       # More sensitive to assistance imbalances (was 10.0)

# Validation Rules: Can also be customized
validation:
  student_id_length: 9
  max_name_length: 50
  min_academic_score: 0.0
  max_academic_score: 100.0
  valid_behavior_ranks:
    - A
    - B
    - C
    - D
  valid_boolean_values:

    - 'false'
    - '1'
    - '0'
    - 'yes'
    - 'no'
    - 'True'
