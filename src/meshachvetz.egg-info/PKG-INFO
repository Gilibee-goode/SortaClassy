```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv meshachvetz_env

# Activate virtual environment
# Windows: meshachvetz_env\Scripts\activate

### ‚úÖ Verify Installation

After installation, test that everything works:

**Windows:** Double-click `run_meshachvetz.bat`
**Mac/Linux:** Run `./run_meshachvetz.sh`

You should see the help message if everything is working correctly.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare Your Data
Create a CSV file with student data following the specified format (see [Data Format Specification](docs/02_data_format_specification.md)).

### 2. Score an Assignment
```python
from meshachvetz import Scorer

# Create scorer with default configuration
scorer = Scorer()

# Score a CSV file
result = scorer.score_csv_file('students.csv')

# Display results
print(f"Final Score: {result.final_score:.2f}/100")
print(f"Student Satisfaction: {result.student_layer_score:.2f}/100")
print(f"Class Balance: {result.class_layer_score:.2f}/100")
print(f"School Balance: {result.school_layer_score:.2f}/100")

# Generate detailed report
report = scorer.get_detailed_report(result)
print(report)
```

### 3. Customize Configuration
```python
from meshachvetz import Scorer, Config

# Load custom configuration
config = Config('config/custom_scoring.yaml')

# Or modify weights programmatically
config = Config()
config.update_weights(
    friends=0.8,        # Higher weight for friend satisfaction
    student_layer=0.6   # Higher weight for student layer
)

scorer = Scorer(config)
result = scorer.score_csv_file('students.csv')
```

### 4. Run Demo
```bash
python examples/demo_scorer.py
```

## Command-Line Interface

For users who prefer command-line tools, Meshachvetz includes a comprehensive CLI:

### Basic Usage

**Windows:**
```bash
# Score student assignments
run_meshachvetz.bat score your_students.csv

# Generate detailed reports
run_meshachvetz.bat score your_students.csv --reports

# Validate data format
run_meshachvetz.bat validate your_students.csv

# View configuration
run_meshachvetz.bat show-config
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Score student assignments
./run_meshachvetz.sh score your_students.csv

# Generate detailed reports
./run_meshachvetz.sh score your_students.csv --reports

# Validate data format
./run_meshachvetz.sh validate your_students.csv

# View configuration
./run_meshachvetz.sh show-config
```

### Example Output

```
üèÜ MESHACHVETZ SCORING RESULTS
Final Score: 99.84/100

üìä Layer Breakdown:
   Student Layer: 100.00/100 (weight: 0.5)
   Class Layer:   100.00/100 (weight: 0.2)
   School Layer:  99.48/100 (weight: 0.3)

üë• Students: 30 | Classes: 5
üìà Friend Satisfaction: 100.0% | Conflicts: 0.0%
```

### Advanced Options

**Windows:**
```bash
# Adjust scoring weights
run_meshachvetz.bat score students.csv --student-weight 0.7 --class-weight 0.2

# Quiet mode for scripts
run_meshachvetz.bat score students.csv --quiet

# Verbose output with detailed analysis
run_meshachvetz.bat score students.csv --verbose --detailed
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Adjust scoring weights
./run_meshachvetz.sh score students.csv --student-weight 0.7 --class-weight 0.2

# Quiet mode for scripts
./run_meshachvetz.sh score students.csv --quiet

# Verbose output with detailed analysis
./run_meshachvetz.sh score students.csv --verbose --detailed
```

- [ ] Comprehensive testing and debugging

See [Implementation Plan](docs/05_implementation_plan.md) for detailed roadmap.

## Usage Examples

### Scoring System Architecture

The Meshachvetz scoring system uses a three-layer architecture:

1. **Student Layer (Individual Satisfaction)**
   - Friend Satisfaction: How many preferred friends are in the same class
   - Conflict Avoidance: How many disliked peers are avoided

2. **Class Layer (Intra-Class Balance)**
   - Gender Balance: How evenly distributed genders are within each class

3. **School Layer (Inter-Class Balance)**
   - Academic Balance: How evenly academic scores are distributed across classes
   - Behavior Balance: How evenly behavior ranks are distributed across classes
   - Size Balance: How evenly students are distributed across classes
   - Assistance Balance: How evenly assistance packages are distributed across classes

### Sample Output

```
üèÜ SCORING RESULTS
Final Score: 75.18/100
Total Students: 8
Total Classes: 3

üìä Layer Breakdown:
   Student Layer: 61.25/100 (weight: 0.5)
   Class Layer:   77.78/100 (weight: 0.2)
   School Layer:  96.67/100 (weight: 0.3)

üë• Student Satisfaction Analysis:
   Average Satisfaction: 61.25/100
   Highly Satisfied (‚â•75): 4/8
   Students with Friends Placed: 4/8
   Students with Conflicts: 1/8
```
