  - Best-of Strategy: Find and return the highest-scoring algorithm result
- **Unified CLI Interface**: Single `optimize` command handles both single and multiple algorithms
  - `--algorithm` for single algorithm optimization
  - `--algorithms` for multi-algorithm comparison/coordination
  - `--strategy` for coordination strategies (best_of, sequential, parallel)

- **Sequential Chaining**: Combines strengths (random_swap → local_search → genetic)
- **Fair Comparison**: Same starting assignment ensures pure algorithm performance testing

**CLI Examples Working**:
```bash
# Single algorithm optimization
./run_meshachvetz.sh optimize students.csv --algorithm genetic

# Multi-algorithm comparison (find best)
./run_meshachvetz.sh optimize students.csv --algorithms local_search genetic --strategy best_of

# Algorithm chaining (sequential improvement)
./run_meshachvetz.sh optimize students.csv --algorithms random_swap local_search genetic --strategy sequential
```
