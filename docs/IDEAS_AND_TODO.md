## üîß **Algorithm Improvements**

### **Local Search Enhancements**
- **Priority: High** 
- **Idea**: Enhance Local Search to move groups of friends instead of single students
- **Details**:
  - Currently moves individual students, which can break friend groups
  - Should identify friend clusters and move them together
  - Example: If students A, B, C are mutual friends, move all three to maximize satisfaction
  - Implementation: Add `_move_friend_group()` method to `LocalSearchOptimizer`
  - Benefits: Better friend satisfaction, more realistic moves

- **Priority: High**
- **Idea**: Add swap operations to Local Search
- **Details**:
  - Currently only does single moves (student ‚Üí class)
  - Should add swap operations (student1 ‚Üî student2 between classes)
  - More efficient than individual moves for maintaining class balance
  - Implementation: Add `_try_swap_students()` method
  - Benefits: Better exploration, maintains class sizes

### **Genetic Algorithm Improvements**
- **Priority: Medium**
- **Idea**: Add friend-aware crossover operators
- **Details**: Design crossover that preserves friend groups when possible

### **Simulated Annealing Improvements**
- **Priority: Medium**
- **Idea**: Adaptive temperature scheduling based on constraint satisfaction
- **Details**: Adjust cooling rate based on how many constraints are being violated

## üñ•Ô∏è **User Interface Enhancements**

### **Real-Time GUI for Manual Assignment**
- **Priority: High** ‚≠ê
- **Idea**: Create a graphical interface for manual student assignment with real-time scoring
- **Details**:
  - **Visual Class Layout**: Show classes as containers with student cards
  - **Drag & Drop**: Allow users to drag students between classes
  - **Real-Time Scoring**: Update scores immediately when students are moved
  - **Score Breakdown**: Show detailed scoring (student layer, class layer, school layer)
  - **Constraint Violations**: Highlight violations in red (force constraints, min_friends)
  - **Friend Connections**: Visual lines/indicators showing friend relationships
  - **Undo/Redo**: Allow reverting moves
  - **Export**: Save manual assignments to CSV
- **Technology Options**:
  - **Web-based**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript with Flask/FastAPI backend
  - **Desktop**: tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy
  - **Modern Web**: React/Vue.js with Python API backend
- **Benefits**: 
  - Intuitive manual fine-tuning after optimization
  - Educational tool to understand scoring system
  - Quick validation of "what-if" scenarios
  - Principal/teacher-friendly interface

### **Interactive CLI Improvements**
- **Priority: Medium**
- **Idea**: Add ASCII art visualization of class layouts
- **Details**: Show simple text-based representation of classes and students

### **Web Dashboard**
- **Priority: Low**
- **Idea**: Create web dashboard for running optimizations remotely
- **Details**: Upload CSV, run optimization, download results

## üìä **Reporting and Analytics**

### **Advanced Reporting**
- **Priority: Medium**
- **Idea**: Generate detailed friendship network analysis
- **Details**: 
  - Show friendship graphs with NetworkX
  - Identify isolated students
  - Analyze friend group clustering effectiveness

### **Comparative Analysis**
- **Priority: Medium**
- **Idea**: Multi-algorithm comparison reports
- **Details**: Run all algorithms on same data and compare results side-by-side

- **Idea**: Add more sophisticated scoring factors
- **Details**:
  - Geographic proximity (if address data available)
  - Learning style compatibility
  - Personality type matching
  - Previous year performance correlation

### **Constraint Soft/Hard Classification**
- **Priority: High**
- **Idea**: Allow marking constraints as "soft" (preferences) vs "hard" (requirements)
- **Details**: 
  - Hard constraints must be satisfied
  - Soft constraints contribute to score but can be violated
  - Configurable per constraint type
